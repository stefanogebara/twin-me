# OpenAI API Key Configuration Issue

## Problem
Embeddings and chat are still failing after OpenAI API key was added to Vercel.

## Root Cause
The code expects the environment variable to be named **exactly**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Check your Vercel environment variables dashboard and ensure the variable is named:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

NOT:
- `OPENAI API KEY` (spaces will cause issues)
- `OPENAI_KEY`
- `OPEN_AI_API_KEY`
- Any other variation

## How to Fix

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Verify the exact name is: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (with underscores, no spaces)
3. If it's named differently, delete the old one and create a new one with the correct name
4. Redeploy the project (or trigger redeploy by pushing a commit)

## Code Reference
File: `api/services/embeddingGenerator.js` line 16
```javascript
this.openaiApiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

File: `api/services/ragService.js` line 25
```javascript
this.openaiApiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

## Testing After Fix
Once corrected, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://twin-ai-learn.vercel.app/api/soul-data/generate-embeddings" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "YOUR_USER_ID", "limit": 5}'
```

Should return: `{"success":true,"generated":5,"errors":0,"total":5}`
