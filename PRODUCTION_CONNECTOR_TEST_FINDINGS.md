## 🎯 What This Means

### ✅ Good News

1. **Security is working correctly** - User data is protected behind authentication
2. **Backend is healthy** - Database connected, APIs responding
3. **Public pages load correctly** - Landing page works for anonymous users
4. **No authentication bypass vulnerabilities** - Can't access protected features without login

### ⚠️ What Needs Manual Testing

**Since automated testing can't authenticate as a real user, the following need manual testing:**

1. **Platform Connections** (8 platforms):
   - Gmail (needs reconnection)
   - Google Calendar (needs reconnection)
   - Discord (should be connected)
   - Reddit (should be connected)
   - Spotify (needs reconnection)
   - YouTube (needs reconnection)
   - Slack (needs fresh connection)
   - LinkedIn (needs fresh connection)

2. **Dashboard Features**:
   - Connection count display
   - Data points statistics
   - Soul signature progress
   - Recent activity feed
   - Personality insights

3. **Data Extraction**:
   - Verify each platform is extracting data
   - Check quality of extracted data
   - Verify browser extension integration

4. **OAuth Flows**:
   - Test each platform's OAuth process
   - Verify tokens are stored correctly
   - Confirm refresh tokens work
