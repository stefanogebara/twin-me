## üéØ Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed ALL Old Education Content
**Issue:** Landing page (Index.tsx) contained extensive outdated education platform content
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Brand confusion, misleading messaging
**Fix Applied:**

**BEFORE (Lines 216-277):**
```jsx
- "Voice Learning" - "Natural conversations with AI teachers"
- "Text Interface" - "ChatGPT-style learning experience"
- "Adaptive AI" - "Personalized teaching that adapts to your learning style"
- "Smart Analytics" - "Track progress and get insights into learning journey"
- "Instant Setup" - "Teachers upload content, AI learns instantly"

About Section:
- "Finally, meet the platform transforming education"
- "We help educators create digital twins"
- "Whether you need to scale your teaching..."

CTA:
- "Ready to transform education?"
- "Join thousands of educators creating digital twins"
```

**AFTER:**
```jsx
- "Platform Integration" - "Connect Netflix, Spotify, Discord, GitHub..."
- "Privacy Control" - "Granular 0-100% sliders for each life cluster"
- "Soul Discovery" - "AI reveals patterns you didn't know about yourself"
- "Contextual Sharing" - "Different twin personas for different contexts"
- "Digital Twin Chat" - "Interact with your authentic digital twin"
- "Instant Creation" - "Connect platforms, deploy your soul signature"

About Section:

- "We create digital twins that capture your true originality"

CTA:
- "Ready to Discover Your Soul Signature?"
- "Join thousands creating authentic digital twins"
```

**Verification:** ‚úÖ Playwright test confirms NO education content detected

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Hero Heading Typography
**Issue:** Line break in heading caused "YourSoul" to run together
**Before:** `Discover Your<br />Soul Signature`
**After:** `Discover Your Soul Signature`
**Verification:** ‚úÖ Test confirms proper spacing

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Applied Cartoon Button Styling
**Issue:** `.cartoon-button` class defined in CSS but not applied to any buttons
**Fix:** Added `className="cartoon-button text-lg px-10 py-4"` to CTA button
**Verification:** ‚úÖ Test detects 1 cartoon-styled button

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Added Testimonials Section
**Issue:** ArtemisTestimonialsSection component not included on landing page
**Fix:** Imported and added `<ArtemisTestimonialsSection />` to Index.tsx
**Verification:** ‚úÖ Test confirms testimonials section present

---

## üî¥ Remaining Issues

### 1. ‚ùå API Endpoint 404 Error
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/platforms`
**Status:** 404 Not Found
**Root Cause:** Endpoint exists at `/api/mcp/platforms` not `/api/platforms`

**Evidence from codebase:**
```javascript
// api/server.js:181
app.use('/api/mcp', mcpRoutes);

// api/routes/mcp.js:162
router.get('/platforms', async (req, res) => { ... }
```

**Recommendation:**
- Option A: Update frontend to use `/api/mcp/platforms`
- Option B: Add route alias at `/api/platforms` ‚Üí `/api/mcp/platforms`
- **Priority:** LOW (endpoint not currently used in frontend)

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Theme Toggle Not Visible
**Issue:** Theme toggle component imported but not detected by Playwright
**Code Location:** `Index.tsx:130` - `<ThemeToggle />` is present
**Possible Causes:**
- Component may be hidden/collapsed
- Aria-label or class name not matching test selectors
- CSS visibility issue

**Recommendation:**
- Verify ThemeToggle component renders correctly
- Check if toggle is inside collapsed navigation on mobile
- Add explicit test selector (e.g., `data-testid="theme-toggle"`)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
