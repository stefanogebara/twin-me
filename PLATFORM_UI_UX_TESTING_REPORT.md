---

## Critical Issues üî¥

### 1. **WebSocket Infinite Reconnection Loop** (BLOCKER)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Location:** All pages
**Impact:** Performance degradation, console spam, token limit issues in testing

**Symptoms:**
```
[WebSocket] Connecting to ws://localhost:3001/ws... (attempt 1/10)
[WebSocket] ‚ùå Disconnected
[WebSocket] üîÑ Reconnecting in 5s... (attempt 1/10)
[WebSocket] Connecting to ws://localhost:3001/ws... (attempt 2/10)
[WebSocket] ‚ùå Disconnected
[WebSocket] üîÑ Reconnecting in 10s... (attempt 2/10)
```

**Root Cause:** WebSocket server either not running or connection logic failing continuously. The exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s) indicates proper retry logic, but the underlying connection issue needs resolution.

**Recommendation:**
- Check if WebSocket server is properly initialized on backend port 3001
- Verify WebSocket upgrade headers are correctly configured
- Consider implementing a max retry limit (currently infinite)
- Add connection status indicator to UI so users know when WebSocket is disconnected
- Investigate why connections are immediately disconnecting after successful connection

**File:** Check `api/server.js` or WebSocket initialization code

---

### 2. **Backend API Errors** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Various features may not work correctly

**Errors Discovered:**

#### a. **415 Unsupported Media Type** - `/api/analytics/session-end`
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/session-end 415 (Unsupported Media Type)
```
**Recommendation:** Check `Content-Type` headers and body parser middleware configuration in Express.

#### b. **401 Unauthorized** - `/api/auth/verify`
```
GET http://localhost:3001/api/auth/verify 401 (Unauthorized)
```
**Note:** This may be expected behavior for token validation, but verify it's not causing unintended side effects.

#### c. **Token Decryption Errors** (Backend Logs)
```
Token decryption error: Unsupported state or unable to authenticate data
Failed to decrypt token - data may be corrupted or key mismatch
```
**Recommendation:**
- Verify encryption key consistency between token creation and validation
- Check if `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable matches across deployments
- Consider token format migration if schema changed

---

## High Priority Issues üü†

### 3. **Missing Route: /chat**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Navigation
**Evidence:** Screenshot `08-chat-404-page-not-found.png`

**Issue:** Sidebar navigation or user expectation may lead to `/chat` route, but it doesn't exist. The actual route is `/talk-to-twin`.

**Recommendation:**
- Add a redirect from `/chat` to `/talk-to-twin` in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/chat" element={<Navigate to="/talk-to-twin" replace />} />
```
- Or update any references that might use `/chat` instead of `/talk-to-twin`

**File:** `src/App.tsx:340`

---

### 4. **Settings Page: "Loading connection status..." Spinner**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Settings page - Connected Services section
**Evidence:** Screenshot `10-settings-page.png`

**Issue:** The "Loading connection status..." spinner with rotating icon appears indefinitely, suggesting the API call is failing or not returning data.

**Recommendation:**
- Check `/api/platforms/status` endpoint functionality
- Add error state handling if API call fails
- Implement timeout with error message after 5-10 seconds
- Add retry button for failed loads

**File:** `src/pages/Settings.tsx` (likely around connected services section)

---

## Medium Priority Issues üü°

### 5. **Training Page: Inconsistent Data**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Model Training page
**Evidence:** Screenshot `12-training-page.png`

**Observations:**
- "Training Samples: 0" shown
- "Collected from 3 platforms" shown
- Start Training button is disabled with tooltip "Connect platforms and collect data before training"
- But Settings shows Gmail and Google Calendar as "Connected"

**Issue:** The platform count (3 platforms) doesn't match the connected platforms count shown elsewhere (8 platforms connected on Connect Data page: Google, Spotify, YouTube, GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord, Steam, Twitch).

**Recommendation:**
- Verify data synchronization between platforms connection status and training data sources
- If only certain platforms provide training data, clarify this in the UI
- Update the count to reflect actual connected platforms or explain the discrepancy

---

### 6. **Connect Data Page: Token Expiration Not Auto-Refreshing**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Location:** Connect Data page - Data Verification section
**Evidence:** Screenshot `02-data-verification-token-expired.png`

**Observations:**
- Spotify: "Token Expired" with "Reconnect" button (red badge)
- YouTube: "Token Expired" with "Reconnect" button (red badge)

**Issue:** Despite cron job running every 5 minutes for token refresh (verified in previous deployment), tokens are showing as expired and requiring manual reconnection.

**Possible Causes:**
1. Cron job not running in local development
2. Refresh tokens invalid or missing
3. Token refresh logic failing silently
4. Database not being updated after successful refresh

**Recommendation:**
- Check `api/routes/cron-token-refresh.js` is being called
- Verify Vercel Cron is configured (only runs in production, not locally)
- Add manual "Refresh All Tokens" button to UI for local development
- Check `cron_executions` table for recent execution logs
- Implement local development fallback (polling or manual refresh)

---

## UI/UX Observations & Suggestions üí°

### 7. **Talk to Twin Page: Disabled State Messaging**
**Severity:** LOW
**Location:** Talk to Twin page
**Evidence:** Screenshot `09-talk-to-twin-page.png`

**Observations:**
- Chat interface shows "Connect platforms first" with disabled input
- "Loading your twin data..." spinner shown
- "Connect Platforms First" button shown (disabled)
- Multiple "Connect Platforms" CTAs

**Positive:** Clear messaging about why features are disabled
**Suggestion:** Since platforms ARE connected (8 platforms shown on Connect Data page), this might be a data loading issue. Consider:
- More specific error message if data extraction failed
- Show which platforms are connected but need extraction
- Loading state should resolve to either success or error, not stay indefinitely
