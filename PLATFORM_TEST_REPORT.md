### 3. Backend Service Errors üîß
**Issues:**
- Missing API endpoints for twin status

- Possible database sync issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. **Fix Chat API Endpoints**
   - Implement `/api/twin/status` endpoint
   - Fix platform status retrieval
   - Add proper error handling

2. **Synchronize Connection Status**
   - Single source of truth for platform connections
   - Remove localStorage dependency
   - Use backend API as authoritative source

3. **Fix Training Data Counter**
   - Ensure sample count matches actual data
   - Sync with platform connection status

### Quality Improvements:
1. **Add Loading States**
   - Prevent errors from showing during data fetch
   - Better user feedback during async operations

2. **Implement Global State Management**
   - Consider Redux or Zustand for connection status
   - Prevent data inconsistencies across pages

3. **Add Error Boundaries**
   - Catch component-level errors
   - Provide fallback UI for failures
