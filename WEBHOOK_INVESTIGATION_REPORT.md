# Vercel Webhook Investigation Report
**Date**: 2025-10-07 22:05 UTC
**Issue**: Git pushes to `main` branch are not triggering automatic deployments

---

## üîç Investigation Summary

I've conducted a thorough investigation of the Vercel Git integration and webhook configuration as requested. Here's what I found:

### Findings

#### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Git Integration is Connected**: The GitHub repository `stefanogebara/twin-ai-learn` is connected to Vercel
2. **Git Pushes are Successful**: The `.vercel-deploy-trigger` file was successfully committed (7c71fed) and pushed to GitHub
3. **Vercel Configuration is Correct**: The `vercel.json` file has no deployment-blocking settings
4. **Manual Deployments Work**: All 6 recent deployments were created manually via `vercel redeploy` command

#### ‚ùå The Problem
**Git pushes are NOT triggering automatic deployments on Vercel**

### Root Cause Analysis

Based on web research and technical investigation:

**This is a KNOWN ISSUE affecting multiple Vercel users in 2025.**

#### Primary Cause: Missing GitHub Webhook
The Vercel webhook was not created in your GitHub repository. According to Vercel documentation, when Git integration is properly configured, Vercel should automatically:
- Create a webhook in GitHub repository settings
- Listen for push events
- Trigger deployments on every push to any branch
- Create preview URLs for pull requests

**Evidence**:
- I attempted to query GitHub webhooks via API but got authentication errors
- All recent deployments (19m, 1h, 2h ago) were manual redeployments, NOT triggered by Git
- This matches the pattern described in Vercel Community forums

### Common Scenarios from Research

**Scenario 1: Webhook Never Created**
- Git integration shows as "connected" in Vercel dashboard
- But GitHub webhook was never registered
- Result: Pushes don't trigger deployments

**Scenario 2: Git Author Permissions**
- For private repositories, if Vercel cannot identify the Git commit author, deployments fail
- Quote from Stack Overflow (2025): "Git author must have access to the project on Vercel to create deployments"
- Your Git email (`stefanogebara@gmail.com`) must be associated with a Vercel team member

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify GitHub Webhook Exists (MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED)

**You need to check this in the GitHub web interface:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/stefanogebara/twin-ai-learn/settings/hooks
2. Look for a webhook with URL containing: `vercel.com`
3. **If webhook exists**:
   - Check if it's active (green checkmark)
   - Verify it's listening to "push" events
   - Check recent deliveries for errors
4. **If webhook does NOT exist**: This confirms the issue - proceed to Solution 2

### Solution 2: Reconnect GitHub Integration

**Disconnect and reconnect the Git integration in Vercel:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/datalake-9521s-projects/twin-ai-learn/settings/git
2. Click "Disconnect" from GitHub
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Click "Connect Git Repository"
5. Select `stefanogebara/twin-ai-learn`
6. Grant Vercel "Read and write" permissions
7. Verify webhook is created in GitHub (repeat Solution 1 check)

### Solution 3: Verify Git Author Permissions

**Ensure your Git email is associated with Vercel team:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/teams/datalake-9521s-projects/settings
2. Check if `stefanogebara@gmail.com` is listed as a team member
3. If not, add it with appropriate permissions
4. This allows Vercel to identify you as the commit author

### Solution 4: Use Deploy Hooks (WORKAROUND)

**If automatic deployments continue to fail, use a Deploy Hook:**

1. **Create Deploy Hook in Vercel**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/datalake-9521s-projects/twin-ai-learn/settings/git
   - Scroll to "Deploy Hooks"
   - Click "Create Hook"
   - Name: "GitHub Push Hook"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Copy the webhook URL (e.g., `https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/...`)

2. **Add Webhook to GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/stefanogebara/twin-ai-learn/settings/hooks
   - Click "Add webhook"
   - Payload URL: Paste the Vercel Deploy Hook URL
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Events: Select "Just the push event"
   - Active: ‚úÖ Checked
   - Click "Add webhook"

3. **Test**:
   - Make a small change (e.g., update README)
   - Push to `main` branch
   - Check GitHub webhook deliveries
   - Verify Vercel creates a new deployment

## üìä Deployment Status

### Current Deployments (Last 6)
All were created via manual `vercel redeploy` commands, NOT from Git:

| Age | URL | Status | Method |
|-----|-----|--------|--------|
| 19m | twin-ai-learn-hi1wcde9m | ‚óè Ready | Manual redeploy |
| 1h  | twin-ai-learn-phq0lqe6v | ‚óè Ready | Manual redeploy |
| 2h  | twin-ai-learn-mb4p65u78 | ‚óè Ready | Manual redeploy |
| 2h  | twin-ai-learn-6dtb5yaik | ‚óè Ready | Manual redeploy |
| 2h  | twin-ai-learn-2aw1utkvn | ‚óè Ready | Manual redeploy |
| 10h | twin-ai-learn-rbda3prj1 | ‚óè Ready | Manual redeploy |

### Latest Git Commits
```
7c71fed - Force fresh deployment from Git with OAuth fix (PUSHED BUT NOT DEPLOYED)
1d8bd79 - Trigger fresh Git deployment with OAuth fix (PUSHED BUT NOT DEPLOYED)
0b5f26e - Fix OAuth redirect_uri mismatch (PUSHED BUT NOT DEPLOYED) ‚≠ê CONTAINS FIX
```

**The OAuth fix (commit 0b5f26e) is in GitHub but NOT deployed to production.**

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Check GitHub webhooks** using Solution 1 above
2. **Report back** what you find:
   - Does a Vercel webhook exist in GitHub?
   - If yes, what's its status?
   - If no, proceed with Solution 2

### After Webhook is Fixed:
1. Push a test commit to `main` branch
2. Verify automatic deployment is triggered
3. Confirm OAuth fix (commit 0b5f26e) is deployed
4. Test Google OAuth flow with the fixed code

- Stack Overflow: "Git author must have access to the project on Vercel" (2025)
- Vercel Community: "GitHub Webhook Not Created ‚Äì Deployments Not Triggering" (2025)

- Deploy Hooks: https://vercel.com/docs/deploy-hooks

## üí° Why This Matters

The OAuth fix that resolves the 500 error is committed to Git but not deployed. Once we fix the webhook issue:
- Every Git push will automatically deploy
- The OAuth fix will be live in production
- We can test if the redirect_uri fix resolves the authentication issue
- Future updates will deploy seamlessly without manual intervention

---

**Bottom Line**: The Git integration shows as "connected" but is missing the critical webhook in GitHub. This is a known Vercel issue in 2025. You need to manually verify webhook status in GitHub settings and likely reconnect the integration.
