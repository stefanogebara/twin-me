### Test 4: Platform Connector Elements ⚠️ WARNING

**Test:** Search for platform connector UI elements

**Results:**
- Platform elements found: 0
- Connect buttons found: 0
- Data attributes: 0

**Analysis:**
This is expected behavior - platform connectors require user authentication. The page likely shows a login prompt or redirects to auth.

**Results:**
- Console errors: **0** ✅
