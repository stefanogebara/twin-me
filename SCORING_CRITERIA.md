# Soul Signature Scoring Criteria

## Overview

The Soul Signature platform uses two distinct scoring systems to evaluate personality analysis:

1. **Confidence Score** (0-100%) - How confident the AI is in the analysis
2. **Uniqueness Score** (0-100%) - How unique/distinctive your personality signature is

## Confidence Score

### What It Measures
The confidence score indicates **how reliable and accurate** the personality analysis is based on the amount and quality of data available.

### Calculation Source
- Generated by **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** during stylometric analysis
- Located in: `api/services/stylometricAnalyzer.js`
- Stored in: `user_style_profile.confidence_score`

### Factors Affecting Confidence

| Factor | Impact on Confidence |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Sample Size** | More text samples = higher confidence |
| **Data Quality** | Clean, complete data = higher confidence |
| **Consistency** | Consistent writing patterns = higher confidence |
| **Platform Variety** | Multiple data sources = higher confidence |

### Interpretation

- **0-30%**: Insufficient data - more platforms needed
- **30-50%**: Limited confidence - basic patterns detected
- **50-70%**: Moderate confidence - good personality insights
- **70-85%**: High confidence - reliable personality profile
- **85-100%**: Very high confidence - comprehensive analysis

### Display Location
- **Twin Chat**: Shows as "{confidence}% confidence" badge (e.g., "85% confidence")
- **Soul Dashboard**: Analysis confidence metric
- **Style Profile**: `profile.confidence_score` field

## Uniqueness Score

### What It Measures
The uniqueness score indicates **how distinctive and original** your personality is compared to average population baselines.

### Calculation Source
- Computed in: `src/pages/SoulSignatureDashboard.tsx` (lines 68-126)
- Function: `calculateUniquenessScore(profile)`
- Based on personality traits, communication style, and writing characteristics

### Scoring Components

#### 1. Vocabulary Richness (0-30 points)
- Measures diversity of word usage
- Formula: `vocabulary_richness * 100 * 0.3`
- Higher vocabulary diversity = more unique

#### 2. Personality Trait Variance (0-25 points)
- Measures deviation from baseline (0.5 = average person)
- Analyzes all Big Five traits:
  - Openness
  - Conscientiousness
  - Extraversion
  - Agreeableness
  - Neuroticism
- Formula: `average_deviation_from_0.5 * 100`
- More extreme traits = more unique

#### 3. Communication Style Uniqueness (0-20 points)
- "Balanced" style: 5 points (common)
- Non-balanced styles: 15 points (distinctive)
- Styles: direct, collaborative, analytical, expressive, etc.

#### 4. Writing Complexity (0-15 points)
- Sentence structure sophistication
- Formula: `sentence_complexity * 100 * 0.15`
- More complex writing = more unique

#### 5. Confidence Bonus (0-10 points)
- Only added if `confidence_score > 0.7`
- Formula: `(confidence - 0.7) * 100 / 3`
- Rewards high-confidence analyses

### Interpretation

- **0-20%**: Generic profile - very common patterns
- **20-40%**: Somewhat typical - few distinctive traits
- **40-60%**: Moderately unique - balanced personality
- **60-80%**: Quite distinctive - notable characteristics
- **80-100%**: Highly unique - exceptional personality signature

### Display Location
- **Soul Dashboard**: Central visualization showing "{uniqueness}% Uniqueness Score"
- **Example**: "67% Uniqueness" means moderately-to-highly distinctive personality

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Confidence Score | Uniqueness Score |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Measures** | Analysis reliability | Personality distinctiveness |
| **Source** | AI analysis quality | Personality trait analysis |
| **Improves with** | More data, better quality | More extreme/distinctive traits |
| **Low score means** | Need more data | More average personality |
| **High score means** | Reliable analysis | Highly distinctive personality |

## Examples

### Example 1: New User
- **Confidence**: 35% (limited data from 2 platforms)
- **Uniqueness**: 52% (moderately unique based on available data)
- **Interpretation**: The analysis is preliminary, but shows moderate distinctiveness

### Example 2: Established User
- **Confidence**: 85% (extensive data from 8 platforms)
- **Uniqueness**: 67% (quite distinctive personality)
- **Interpretation**: High-quality analysis shows notable unique characteristics

### Example 3: Very Unique User
- **Confidence**: 78% (good data quality)
- **Uniqueness**: 89% (highly distinctive)
- **Interpretation**: Reliable analysis of an exceptionally unique personality

## FAQ

### Why is my confidence low but uniqueness high?
Your personality is distinctive, but we need more data to be confident in that assessment. Connect more platforms!

### Why is my uniqueness score moderate?
Having a balanced, "average" personality is completely normal and healthy. Uniqueness measures extremity, not quality.

### How can I improve my confidence score?
1. Connect more platforms (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, etc.)
2. Ensure platforms have substantial data (100+ emails, events, etc.)
3. Run the soul extraction pipeline multiple times

### How can I change my uniqueness score?
You can't directly change it - it reflects your authentic personality based on your digital footprint. It's a measurement, not a goal.
